# Advent of Code 2024

The solution of Advent of Code 2024

## **Disclaimer**
Copying code without thoughtful consideration leads to a deficiency in problem-solving skills, resembling a mindset fixated on solutions rather than the thinking process.

## **Purposed**
- To better understand the solution when you encounter challenges.
- To enhance proficiency in algorithmic thinking, abstraction, and computer science concepts, including data structures and beyond.

## **Noted**
- day_18 part 2: suggest to change from recursion to dynamic programming to optimize the algorithm because Big-O, O(4^n), is too high which leads to find the answer very slow. I will do the dynamic programming version as soon as possible.
